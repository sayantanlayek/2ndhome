						Welcome to 2'nd Home – the world of authentic, traditional cuisine served home-style in a cosy and comfortable ambience. 2'nd Home started out as a single outlet in 2018, an enterprise taken up by Mrs. Puja Layek from Dumka Ranchi, whose dream was to set up a restaurant catering quality meal to all the food Lover of Ranchi

						It all started with a first-generation Jhearkhandi entrepreneur coming into the foray, not with the dream of offering a fine-dining experience, but the idea to serve simple essential meals, a home cuisine away from home.For us, sustainability is not a lofty idea but a fundamental, and necessary, endeavor. Our concept is about the food and drink of course, but it’s also about our team, our facilities, our practices, and the hundreds of decisions we make each day that affect the world around us. We believe it’s about finding a balance, which allows us to sustain our quest of making quality, accessible food, while also giving back to our community and the environment.
